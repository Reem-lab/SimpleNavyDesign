                    <p> 
                        Established in 1983, ETMS is one of the first private maritime companies in Egypt. We started as a ship agency at all Egyptian ports and Suez Canal representing and serving owners of reefer livestock, bulk, general cargo, and heavy-lift vessels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In 1987, the company became very active in time-chartering as well as booking vessel spaces for special projects; IMO, bulk, and reefer cargo, serving mainly the North Continent Med trade.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        From 1990 to 2015, we commercially operated a variety of ships, and fully managed others in both tramping and semi-liner trades. The ships varied between general cargo, MPP, RORO, and reefer types.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        During this period, the agency department has vastly grown to be offering a wide range of services including cargo / operations survey, stevedoring, storage, and cargo handling at all local ports, specializing in heavy projects and dangerous goods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                       With a view to expanding further, a sophisticated logistics department has been integrated into our activities chain to deliver cost-effective customs clearance and land transportation services.
                       And more is yet to comeâ€¦
